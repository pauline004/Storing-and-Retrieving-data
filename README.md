# SQL Project 
Repository for storing the Storing and Retrieving data project for the NOVA IMS master course (academic year 2021/2022), using SQL.

## Objective
Think about any commercial business process of a product or service that needs a relational database 
to work and Design and create an ERD in MySQL workbench.  The ERD should not have less than 10 tables and create two triggers: (1) one for updates and (2) a trigger that inserts a row in a “log” table (your ERD should include a log table). Finally, create a physical relational database based on your ERD.
